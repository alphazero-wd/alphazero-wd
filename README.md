**About me**: 
- I'm a high school student. I've have been a programmer and web developer for more than a year. 

- My interests are making web applications and solving problems on Leetcode. I'm looking forward to collaborate with other developers to help me acquire more knowledge and level up my technical skills as well as learning more fields in software engineering like mobile development, desktop development, game development, etc. . 

- During my journey as a programmer, I've learned C#, Python and Javascript but Javascript/Typescript is my specialized language.

**Technologies I have learned**:
